# Contributing to SlowMovie
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Getting Started

Before jumping right into making a new issue please see if you've tried the following: 

1. Go through the [README](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie/blob/master/README.md) and make sure you're following the steps exactly
2. Search [current Issues](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie/issues) and see if this is a known problem, perhaps even being worked on already.

## Opening An Issue
We use GitHub issues to track issues. Report a something by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie/issues); it's that easy! There are a few templates to choose from, pick the one that works best for your situation: 

* __Bug__ - choose this if you're having trouble getting things working or things just aren't working as you expect
* __Feature Request__ - request something new be added. 
* __Informational__ - have a comment or something that just doesn't fit the other two categories, try this. 

### Pay attention to the details!

**Great** Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

A thorough bug reports is your best change things can be fixed quickly. 

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from the one you want to make changes to (usually `master`).
2. If you've changed functionality or dependencies, update the documentation.
3. Issue that pull request! Be sure to include relevant information per the PR template. 

### Review Process
Once submitted your PR will get reviewed - be patient. Depending on the complexity of the change it may take some time and even some back and forth to get things all squared away. You may even be asked to change something, it's all part of the process. 

Once everything looks good your PR will be merged!
