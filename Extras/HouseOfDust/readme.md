# House of Dust  

This script is a loose recreation of Alison Knowles early computer-generated poem [A House of Dust](https://zkm.de/en/artwork/house-of-dust)  

The code is based on [Nick Monfort's recreation](https://nickm.com/memslam/) that was created for & presented at the first NYU ITP Code Poetry Slam in 2014.
